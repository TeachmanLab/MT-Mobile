      title: 'What will I be asked to do?',
      content: 'The assessments consist of a number of questionnaires about your thoughts and mood, your background, and personal mental health history You will be asked to complete four assessment parts total: prior to Training Session 1, after Training Sessions 3 and 5, and two months following Training Session 5\n\nIn the Training Sessions, you will be presented with one of a few different training programs designed to shift how you think about situations You may be asked to read information about anxiety problems and their treatment, and answer questions, or read brief stories and complete word fragments, by filling in one or more missing letters in a word We are testing which program most effectively reduces anxiety\n\nAlthough our prediction of which training program will be most effective is based on previous work in the laboratory, it is important to compare the effects of each program in the real world before drawing any conclusions In psychology research, a common way to compare programs is to randomly assign each participant to one of the training versions\n\nIf you get randomly assigned to a program that we do not think will be the strongest one, you will have the opportunity to complete the program that we expect to be most effective after you finish the study In other words, EVERYBODY will eventually get the chance to try the program that we expect will be most effective'

      title: 'What else should I know about participating?',
      content:
      'Some participants may be asked to work briefly with a support coach via phone, email, and/or texts, to discuss your progress in the study. After an initial call – which would occur shortly after Training Session 1 – your weekly phone contact with the coach will be brief (typically 2-10 minutes). The coach will not be providing therapy, but can address questions, support your work, and help troubleshoot any issues that that come up when interacting with the online training program.\n\nAt the end of the study, you will receive more details about the study’s rationale and design. You will also receive feedback about the progress you made during the program.'

            'MindTrails uses the same secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) that banks and other commercial websites use to transfer credit card information in an encrypted format. This provides strong security for data transfer to and from our website, though privacy is necessarily limited by the security of the technology that is being used. To view the entire privacy policy in a separate page, please click here.\n\nPlease note that completing the study in a public place where others might view your screen, and use of open networks or free Wi-Fi can increase the chance for loss of privacy.\n\nGoogle Analytics\nMindTrails uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. MindTrails uses this service to track device usage, navigation patterns, and referrals. While MindTrails can connect this data to other information you provide, we will not share any of your personal information with Google. The information that Google collects is anonymous in nature, and will not be personally identifiable. By participating in the Calm Thinking study, you consent to this information being collected by Google Analytics.\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health Data Archive\nData from this study may be submitted to the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA). The NDA is a data repository run by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) that allows researchers studying mental health and substance use to collect and share deidentified information with each other. A data repository is a large database where information from many studies is stored and managed. Deidentified information means that all personal information about research participants such as name, address, and phone number is removed and replaced with a code number. With an easier way to share, researchers hope to learn new and important things about mental illnesses more quickly than before.\n\nDuring and after the study, the researchers will send deidentified information about your health and behavior to NDA. Other researchers nationwide can then file an application with the NIMH to obtain access to your deidentified study data for research purposes. Experts at the NIMH who know how to protect health and science information will look at every request carefully to minimize risks to your privacy.\n\nYou may not benefit directly from allowing your information to be shared with NDA. The information provided to NDA may help researchers find better treatments. NIMH will also report to Congress and on its web site about the different studies that researchers are conducting using NDA data. However, you will not be contacted directly about the data you contributed to NDA.\n\nYou may decide now or later that you do not want to share your information using NDA. If so, contact us at studyteam@mindtrails.org, and we will tell NDA, which can stop sharing the research information. Please note that NDA cannot take back information that was shared before you changed your mind. If you would like more information about NDA, this is available online at https://data-archive.nimh.nih.gov/.'
